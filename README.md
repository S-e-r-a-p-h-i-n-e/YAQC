The best way to say "I use Linux btw 🤓" is if your desktop environment looks sleek and suave.

Powered by Hyprland, this project does not define itself as "just a rice." **NeKoRoSHELL DLUX** aims to provide an out-of-the-box, clean and reliable, generic, and modular framework that lets you easily customize your desktop experience with simple UI design philosophy in mind.

## Features

NeKoRoSHELL DLUX focuses on simplicity and modularity.
<br>

The following are what NeKoRoSHELL DLUX currently offers:
- **Portable and Distro-agnostic**
  - Use NeKoRoSHELL DLUX in any **supported** distro!
  - Init-agnostic.
  - XDG-compliant.
  - Features an advanced installer script.
    - Use `git clone https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL DLUX`
    - Then `cd NeKoRoSHELL DLUX`
    - and finally, `bash install.sh` to install the dotfiles.
    - `install.sh` assumes you already have `git` and a distro-specific `g++` compiler.
    - `install.sh` requires you to have `cargo`, `paru`/`yay`, `go`, and `flatpak`.
    - You can freely customize `flatpak.txt` and `pkglist-DISTRO.txt` before running `install.sh`.
    - **The installer is safe.** It backs up your pre-existing .config folders. (If you have any)
    - The installer automatically handles assigning your monitors at `~/.config/hypr/configs/monitors.conf/` and replaces every occurence of `/home/nekorosys/` with your username for your own convenience.
    - SOME distros don't have hyprland or other dependencies on their package manager's repository and you may have to manually build them from source via script or something else.

- **NeKoRoSHELL DLUX as a Service**
  - Update your copy of NeKoRoSHELL DLUX simply by running the `NeKoRoSHELL DLUX update` command on your terminal.
  - Uses Vim or your preferred text editor to assist in reviewing file updates and gives the ability to overwrite, keep, and merge.

### Roadmap

NeKoRoSHELL DLUX is currently being developed by one person (*cough* [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL-DLUX/tree/main?tab=contributing-ov-file#) *cough*) and is constantly under rigorous quality assurance for improvement. We always aim to keep a "no-break" promise for every update so that you can safely update to later versions without expecting any breakages.

## Dependencies

> [!CAUTION]
> **HARDWARE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**<br>
>
> Some environment variables and params at `~/.config/hypr/configs/environment.conf/` and `~/.config/hypr/scripts/set-wallpaper.sh/` (also check the `check-video.sh` script, `mpvpaper` uses a "hwdec=nvdec" param) **require an NVIDIA graphics card**. Although it may be generally safe to leave it as is upon installing to a machine without such GPU, I recommend commenting it out or replacing it with a variable that goes according to your GPU.

> [!WARNING]
> **SOFTWARE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**<br>
>
> This project of mine was originally built only for Arch Linux but is now capable of claiming itself to be Distro-agnostic. However, **installation of this repo in other Linux Distros aside from Arch is more or less UNTESTED.** Please verify using `nano` or your preferred text editor if your distro supports the packages listed at `pkglist-DISTRO.txt` or if the packages are named correctly.
>
> The installation system that I implemented can be improved. If you're willing to help, please make a pull request. Your contributions are welcome and will be appreciated! :D

- `NeKoRoSHELL DLUX update` may use Vim to compare, overwrite, or merge files when updating.
- Requires `quickshell-git` to function.
